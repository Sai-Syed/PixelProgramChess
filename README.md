# PixelProgramChess
This program was for my grade 12 c# final project. It is meant to mimic a real board which I explained in my presentation "represents the way objects in OOP mimic real world objects." I got 100% on it :) but because it mimics a real board you can move any piece anywhere and it can't detect checks or checkmates
